Palanche Industries Web Application Structure

Root Level:
├── src/          - Main frontend application
├── backend/      - Backend API (empty, for senior developer)
├── public/       - Static assets and favicon
├── README.md     - Project documentation
└── configs       - Build and development configuration

Frontend Architecture:
- Vite + React (JSX only, no TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- shadcn/ui component library
- React Query for data fetching

Admin Section:
- Located in /src/admin/
- Logically separated from main app
- Shares build pipeline and dependencies
- Route-based access control

Backend Preparation:
- Empty /backend folder ready for API development
- Environment variables configured
- CORS and API integration planned
- Database connection points prepared

Build Configuration:
- vite.config.js (JavaScript, not TypeScript)
- tailwind.config.js (JavaScript configuration)
- Multi-entry point support for future admin separation
- Environment-based API endpoint configuration

This structure satisfies the senior developer's requirements while working within Lovable's Vite+React framework constraints.
